  "summary": "Diff updates frontend canister ID resolution to use Vite env vars and adds deployment-related documentation/examples, but does not implement creating/redeploying a fresh IC canister nor the required runtime /env.json-based canister ID resolution.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a brand-new Internet Computer canister (do not reuse the existing/invalid canister ID) and redeploy the full app so the resulting public URL resolves successfully (no ICP gateway “Canister ID Not Resolved” / Error 400) and can be shared as a working draft link.",
      "reason": "The diff contains only frontend/documentation changes and no deployment/dfx configuration changes or scripts that would create a new canister ID, stop referencing the old ID, or demonstrate a successful redeploy/shareable icp0.io URL.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_DRAFT_LINK.md",
        "project_state.json"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Frontend must read BACKEND_CANISTER_ID from /env.json when present; otherwise fall back to VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID or VITE_CANISTER_ID_BACKEND; fail gracefully with clear console output.",
      "reason": "frontend/src/canisterId.ts only reads Vite env vars and does not attempt to fetch/read /env.json at runtime. The required priority order (env.json first, then env vars) is therefore not implemented.",

        "frontend/src/canisterId.ts"

      "description": "Added a deployment/shareable URL guide document (including checklist and URL format section).",

    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced host resolution helper (getHost) with logic for local/mainnet defaults.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 is specifically about backend canister ID resolution from env.json/env vars; host selection behavior was not requested.",

        "frontend/src/canisterId.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added/modified a frontend .env example file with deployment guidance text.",
